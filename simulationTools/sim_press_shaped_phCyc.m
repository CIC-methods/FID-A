% coherence selection rather than phase cycling to null undesired signal.

% sim_press_shaped_phCyc.m
% Robin Simpson and Jamie Near, 2014.
% 
% USAGE:
% out = sim_press_shaped_phCyc(n,sw,Bfield,linewidth,sys,tau1,tau2,RF,tp,dx,dy,Gx,Gy,phCyc1,phCyc2,flipAngle,centreFreq)
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% This function simulates the PRESS experiment.  The excitation is
% simulated as an instantaneous rotation, and the refocusing pulse is
% simulated as a shaped rotation.
%
% This code enables the choice of the phase of the refocusing pulses.  This 
% enables phase cycling of the refocusing pulses by repeating simulations 
% with different editing pulse phases, which is necessary to remove phase 
% artefacts from the editing pulses.  A four step phase cycling scheme is typically
% sufficient, where both refocusing pulses are phase cycled by 0 and 90 degrees, and
% the phase are combined in the following way:
% 
% signal = ([0 90] - [0 0]) + ([90 0] - [90 90]);
% 
% where, in [X Y], X is the phase of the first refocusing pulse and Y is
% the phase of the second refocusing pulse
% 
% Finally, this code simulates the spectrum at a given point in space (x,y),
% given the values of the slice selection gradients (Gx, and Gy).  The pulse
% waveform is assumed to be the same for both refocusing pulses.  In order
% to fully simulate the MEGA-PRESS experiment, you have to run this
% simulation many times at various points in space (x,y), and then add
% together the resulting spectra.  
% 
% INPUTS:
% n         = number of points in fid/spectrum
% sw        = desired spectral width in [Hz]
% Bfield    = main magnetic field strength in [T]
% linewidth = linewidth in [Hz]
% sys       = spin system definition structure
% tau1      = echo time 1 in [ms].
% tau2      = echo time 2 in [ms].
% RF        = RF pulse definition structure for refoc pulses (obtain using 'io_loadRFwaveform.m')
% tp        = RF pulse duration in [ms]
% dx        = position offset in x-direction (corresponding to first refocusing pulse) [cm]
% dy        = position offset in y-direction (corresponding to second refocusing pulse) [cm]
% Gx        = gradient strength for first selective refocusing pulse [G/cm]
% Gy        = gradient strength for second selective refocusing pulse [G/cm]
% phCycl    = initial phase of the first refocusing pulse in [degrees];
% phCycl2   = initial phase of the second refocusing pulse in [degrees];
% flipAngle = flip angle of refocusing pulses [degrees] (Optional.  Default = 180 deg)
% centreFreq= centre frequency of the spectrum in [ppm] (Optional.  Default = 2.3)
%
% OUTPUTS:
% out       = simulated spectrum, in FID-A structure format, using PRESS 
%             sequence.
