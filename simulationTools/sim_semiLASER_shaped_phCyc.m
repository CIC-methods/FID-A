% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% This function simulates the semi-LASER experiment as described by Oz et al. (2018).
% The excitation is simulated as an instantaneous rotation, and the two pairs of slice
% selective refocusing adiabatic pulse are simulated as shaped RF pulses.

% This code enables the choice of the phase of the refocusing pulses.
% A four step phase cycling scheme is typically sufficient, where both 
% pairs of refocusing pulses are phase cycled by  0 and 90 degrees, 
% and the phases are combined in the following way:
% 
% signal = ([0 0, 0 0] - [0 0, 0 90]) - ([0 90, 0 0] + [0 90, 0 90]);
%                  
% where, in [X1 X2, Y1 Y2], X1 and X2 are the phases of the first and
% second refocusing pulses along X gradient, respectively, and Y1 and Y2
% are the phase of the third and fourth refocusing pulses along Y gradient.
% 
% Finally, this code simulates the spectrum at a given point in space (x,y),
% given the values of the slice selection gradients (Gx, and Gy).  The pulse
% waveform is assumed to be the same for both refocusing pulses.  In order
% to fully simulate the sLASER experiment, you have to run this
% simulation many times at various points in space (x,y), and then summate
% and scale together the resulting spectra.  
% 
% Feb 2020 - Jamie Near:  This code now accepts gradient modulated pulses.  
% If the input pulse is gradient modulated (waveform has 4 columns), then 
% the input parameters Gx and Gy are scaling factors for the GM function
% in order to achieve the desired slice thickness.
% 
% INPUTS:
% n         = number of points in fid/spectrum
% sw        = desired spectral width in [Hz]
% Bfield    = main magnetic field strength in [T]
% linewidth = linewidth in [Hz]
% sys       = spin system definition structure
% te        = echo time of sLASER experiment (ms)
% RF        = RF pulse definition structure for refoc pulses (obtain using 'io_loadRFwaveform.m')
% tp        = RF pulse duration in [ms]
% dx        = position offset in x-direction (corresponding to first refocusing pulse) [cm]
% dy        = position offset in y-direction (corresponding to second refocusing pulse) [cm]
% Gx        = If RF is not a gradient modulated pulse, Gx is the gradient strength
%             for first selective refocusing pulse [G/cm].  If RF is a gradient
%             modulated pulse, then Gx is a scaling factor for the GM
%             function to achieve the desired slice thickness in the
%             x-direction.  
% Gy        = If RF is not a gradient modulated pulse, Gy is the gradient strength
%             for first selective refocusing pulse [G/cm].  If RF is a gradient
%             modulated pulse, then Gy is a scaling factor for the GM
%             function to achieve the desired slice thickness in the
%             y-direction.  
% phl    = initial phase of the first refocusing pulse in [degrees];
% ph2   = initial phase of the second refocusing pulse in [degrees];
% ph3   = initial phase of the third refocusing pulse in [degrees];
% ph4   = initial phase of the fourth refocusing pulse in [degrees];
% flipAngle = flip angle of refocusing pulses [degrees] (Optional.  Default = 180 deg)
% centreFreq= centre frequency of the spectrum in [ppm] (Optional.  Default = 2.3)
%
% OUTPUTS:
% out       = simulated spectrum, in FID-A structure format, using PRESS 
%             sequence.
