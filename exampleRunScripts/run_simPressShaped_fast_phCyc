% USAGE:
% out=run_simPressShaped_fast_phCyc(spinSys);
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% This script simulates a PRESS experiment with fully shaped refocusing 
% pulses.  Phase cycling of refocusing pulses is performed.  Furthermore, 
% simulations are run at various locations in space to account for the 
% within-voxel spatial variation of the metabolite signal.  Summation 
% across phase cycles and spatial positions is performed.  To achieve 
% faster perfomance compared to the original 'run_simPressShaped.m' function,
% this code uses the method described by Yan Zhang et al. Med Phys 2017;44(8): 
% 4169-78.  Some additional acceleration is currently performed using parfor 
% loops in both x and y directions.  To enable the use of the MATLAB
% parallel computing toolbox, initialize the multiple worked nodes using
% "matlabpool size X" where "X" is the number of available processing
% nodes.  If the parallel processing toolbox is not available, then replace
% the "parfor" loop with a "for" loop.
% 
% INPUTS:
% To run this script, there is technically only one input argument:
% spinSys           = spin system to simulate 
%
% However, the user should also edit the following parameters as 
% desired before running the function:
% refocWaveform     = name of refocusing pulse waveform.
% refTp             = duration of refocusing pulses[ms]
% Bfield            = Magnetic field strength in [T]
% Npts              = number of spectral points
% sw                = spectral width [Hz]
% Bfield            = magnetic field strength [Tesla]
% lw                = linewidth of the output spectrum [Hz]
% thkX              = slice thickness of x refocusing pulse [cm]
% thkY              = slice thickness of y refocusing pulse [cm]
% fovX              = full simulation FOV in the x direction [cm]
% fovY              = full simulation FOV in the y direction [cm]
% nX                = number of spatial grid points to simulate in x-direction
% nY                = number of spatial grid points to simulate in y-direction
% taus              = vector of pulse sequence timings  [ms]
% refPhCyc1         = vector of phase cycling steps for 1st refocusing pulse [degrees]
% refPhCyc2         = vector of phase cycling steps for 2nd refocusing pulse [degrees]
%
% OUTPUTS:
% out               = Simulation results, summed over all space.

% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% This function simulates only the first bit of the PRESS experiment, up to 
% the beginning of the second refocusing pulse.  The excitation is
% simulated as an instantaneous rotation, and the refocusing pulse is
% simulated as a shaped rotation.
%
% This code is designed to be used in highly-accelerated shaped simulations,
% using the method described by Yan Zhang et al. Med Phys 2017;44(8): 
% 4169-78.
%
% This code enables the choice of the phase of the refocusing pulse.  This 
% enables phase cycling of the refocusing pulses by repeating simulations 
% with different editing pulse phases, which is necessary to remove phase 
% artefacts from the editing pulses.  A four step phase cycling scheme is typically
% sufficient, where both refocusing pulses are phase cycled by 0 and 90 degrees, and
% the phase are combined in the following way:
% 
% signal = ([0 90] - [0 0]) + ([90 0] - [90 90]);
% 
% where, in [X Y], X is the phase of the first refocusing pulse and Y is
% the phase of the second refocusing pulse
% 
% Finally, this code simulates the spectrum at a given point in space (x),
% given the values of the slice selection gradient (Gx).  In order
% to fully simulate the MEGA-PRESS experiment, you have to run this
% simulation many times at various points in space (x), followed by
