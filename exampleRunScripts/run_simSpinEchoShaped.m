% USAGE:
% out=run_simSpinEchoShaped(spinSys);
% 
% DESCRIPTION:
% This script simulates a localized spin-echo experiment with a fully shaped  
% refocusing pulse.  Phase cycling of the refocusing pulse is performed.  
% Furthermore, simulations are run at various locations in space (1-D) to 
% account for the within-voxel spatial variation of the metabolite signal 
% due to J-evolution.  Summation across phase cycles and spatial positions is
% performed.  As a result of the phase cycling and spatially resolved simulations, 
% this code takes a long time to run.  Therefore, the MATLAB parallel computing
% toolbox (parfor loop) was used to accelerate the siumulations.  Accelration 
% is performed in the direction of the slice selective refocusing pulse.  
% Up to a factor of 12 acceleration can be achieved using this approach.  
% To enable the use of the MATLAB parallel computing toolbox, initialize 
% the multiple worked nodes using "matlabpool size X" where "X" is the 
% number of available processing nodes.  If the parallel processing toolbox
% is not available, then replace the "parfor" loop with a "for" loop.
